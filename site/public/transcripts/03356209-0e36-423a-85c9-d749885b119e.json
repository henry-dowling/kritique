It combines search and large language models, LLMs, in a way that produces answers where every part of the answer has a citation to human-created sources on the web. This significantly reduces LLM hallucinations, and makes it much easier and more reliable to use for research, and general curiosity-driven late night rabbit hole explorations that I often engage in."

But the way they got their differentiation from other search engines at the time was through a different ranking signal and the fact that it was inspired from academic citation graphs, which coincidentally was also the inspiration for us in Perplexity, citations. You are an academic, you’ve written papers. We all have Google scholars, we all, at least first few papers we wrote, we’d go and look at Google’s scholar every single day and see if the citation is increasing.

The product should understand her intent despite that, and this is a story that Larry says where they just tried to sell Google to Excite and they did a demo to the Excite CEO where they would fire Excite and Google together and type in the same query like university.

Ilya Sutskever wrote the first paper that said, you can just train a simple RNN model, scale it up and it’ll beat all the phrase-based machine translation systems. But that was brute force. There was no attention in it, and spent a lot of Google compute, I think probably like 400 million parameter model or something even back in those days. And then this grad student Bahdanau in Benjio’s lab identifies attention and beats his numbers with [inaudible 01:05:20] compute. So clearly a great idea. And then people at DeepMind figured that this paper called Pixel RNNs figured that you don’t even need RNNs, even though the title is called Pixel RNN. I guess it’s the actual architecture that became popular was WaveNet. And they figured out that a completely convolutional model can do autoregressive modeling as long as you do mass convolutions. The masking was the key idea."

So that way you can utilize the GPU computer a lot more efficiently, because you’re just doing Matmos. And so they just said throw away the RNN. And that was powerful. And so then Google Brain, like Vaswani et al that transformer paper identified that, let’s take the good elements of both. Let’s take attention, it’s more powerful than cons. It learns more higher-order dependencies, because it applies more multiplicative compute. And let’s take the insight in WaveNet that you can just have a all convolutional model that fully parallel matrix multiplies and combine the two together and they built a transformer. And that is the, I would say, it’s almost like the last answer. Nothing has changed since 2017 except maybe a few changes on what the nonlinearities are and how the square descaling should be done. Some of that has changed. And then people have tried mixture of experts having more parameters for the same flop and things like that. But the core transformer architecture has not changed."

You want to do as much parallel compute as possible during training. That way, whatever job was earlier running in eight days would run in a single day. I think that was the most important insight. And whether it’s cons or attention… I guess attention and transformers make even better use of hardware than cons, because they apply more compute per flop. Because in a transformer the self-attention operator doesn’t even have parameters. The QK transpose softmax times V has no parameter, but it’s doing a lot of flops. And that’s powerful. It learns multi-order dependencies. I think the insight then OpenAI took from that is, like Ilya Sutskever has been saying unsupervised learning is important. They wrote this paper called Sentiment Neuron, and then Alec Radford and him worked on this paper called GPT-1."

Which means if you run the same job, you would get something that’s way better if you apply the same amount of compute.

And there are some interesting research directions here, like Microsoft has been working on this five models where they’re training small language models. They call it SLMs, but they’re only training it on tokens that are important for reasoning. And they’re distilling the intelligence from GPT-4 on it to see how far you can get if you just take the tokens of GPT-4 on datasets that require you to reason, and you train the model only on that. You don’t need to train on all of regular internet pages, just train it on basic common sense stuff. But it’s hard to know what tokens are needed for that. It’s hard to know if there’s an exhaustive set for that."

And how do you make it good at that? By bootstrapping its own reasoning abilities. It’s not that these models are unintelligent, but it’s almost that we humans are only able to extract their intelligence by talking to them in natural language. But there’s a lot of intelligence they’ve compressed in their parameters, which is trillions of them. But the only way we get to extract it is through exploring them in natural language."

Now, there are some imprompts where it’s not going to get it right. Now, instead of just training on the right answer, you ask it to produce an explanation. If you were given the right answer, what is explanation you would provide it, you train on that. And for whatever you got, you just train on the whole string of prompt explanation and output. This way, even if you didn’t arrive at the right answer, if you had been given the hint of the right answer, you’re trying to reason what would’ve gotten me that right answer. And then training on that. And mathematically you can prove that it’s related to the variational, lower bound with the latent."

And if this can be done in a way where you can track a metric, you can start with something that’s like say 30% on some math benchmark and get something like 75, 80%. So I think it’s going to be pretty important. And the way it transcends just being good at math or coding is, if getting better at math or getting better at coding translates to greater reasoning abilities on a wider array of tasks outside of two and could enable us to build agents using those kind of models, that’s when I think it’s going to be getting pretty interesting.

So what LLMs add is even if your initial retrieval doesn’t have a amazing set of documents, like it has really good recall but not as high a precision, LLMs can still find a needle in the haystack and traditional search cannot, because they’re all about precision and recall simultaneously. In Google, even though we call it 10 blue links, you get annoyed if you don’t even have the right link in the first three or four. The eye is so tuned to getting it right. LLMs are fine. You get the right link maybe in the 10th or ninth. You feed it in the model. It can still know that that was more relevant than the first. So that flexibility allows you to rethink where to put your resources in terms of whether you want to keep making the model better or whether you want to make the retrieval stage better. It’s a trade-off. In computer science, it’s all about trade-offs at the end."

It’s very important for you to track the P90 and P99 latencies, which is the 90th and 99th percentile. Because if a system fails 10% of the times and you have a lot of servers, you could have certain queries that are at the tail failing more often without you even realizing it. And that could frustrate some users, especially at a time when you have a lot of queries, suddenly a spike. So it’s very important for you to track the tail latency and we track it at every single component of our system, be it the search layer or the LLM layer."

And they are incentivized to make it better for themselves and customers, so that keeps improving. And for models we serve ourselves like Llama-based models, we can work on it ourselves by optimizing at the kernel level. So there, we work closely with NVIDIA, who’s an investor in us, and we collaborate on this framework called TensorRT-LLM.

If I have no understanding of search, let’s say, and I wanted to start a search company, it will be amazing to have a tool like this where I can just go and ask, “How does bots work?

So I think that’s important. And in terms of what new things it can do, I feel like it can do internal search a lot better. And that’s an area that nobody’s really cracked, like searching over your own files, searching over your Google Drive or Dropbox. And the reason nobody cracked that is because the indexing that you need to build for that is a very different nature than web indexing. And instead, if you can just have the entire thing dumped into your prompt and ask it to find something, it’s probably going to be a lot more capable.

But when you truly have systems that I think that’s where memory becomes an essential component, where it’s lifelong, it knows when to put it into a separate database or data structure. It knows when to keep it in the prompt. And I like more efficient things, so just systems that know when to take stuff in the prompt and put it somewhere else and retrieve when needed.

And I think there are different ways to keep the light of consciousness, preserving it, and we all can go about in different paths. For us, it’s about making sure that it’s even less about that sort of thinking. I just think people are naturally curious. They want to ask questions and we want to serve that mission."

I’ve seen that in wartime when there’s really strong divisions to understanding paves the way for peace and for love between people, because there’s a lot of incentive in war to have very narrow and shallow conceptions of the world. Different truths on each side. So bridging that, that’s what real understanding looks like, real truth looks like. And it feels like AI can do that better than humans do because humans really inject their biases into stuff."

One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day.”"

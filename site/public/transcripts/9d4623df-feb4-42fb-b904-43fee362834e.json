He argues that there’s almost 100% chance that AGI will eventually destroy human civilization. As an aside, let me say that I’ll have many often technical conversations on the topic of AI, often with engineers building the state-of-the-art AI systems. I would say those folks put the infamous P(doom) or the probability of AGI killing all humans at around one to 20%, but it’s also important to talk to folks who put that value at 70, 80, 90, and is in the case of Roman, at 99.99 and many more nines percent."

Yeah, we may succeed and do good job with GPT-5, six, seven, but they just keep improving, learning, eventually self-modifying, interacting with the environment, interacting with malevolent actors. The difference between cybersecurity, narrow AI safety and safety for general AI for superintelligence, is that we don’t get a second chance. With cybersecurity, somebody hacks your account, what’s the big deal? You get a new password, new credit card, you move on. Here, if we’re talking about existential risks, you only get one chance. So you are really asking me what are the chances that we’ll create the most complex software ever on the first try with zero bugs and it’ll continue to have zero bugs for a hundred years or more."

Superintelligence was defined as a system which is superior to all humans in all domains. Now people are starting to refer to AGI as if it’s superintelligence. I made a post recently where I argued, for me at least, if you average out over all the common human tasks, those systems are already smarter than an average human. So under that definition we have it. Shane Legg has this definition of where you’re trying to win in all domains. That’s what intelligence is.

We are designing it. We are making decisions about it. That’s not true. It was true when we had expert systems, symbolic AI decision trees. Today, you set up parameters for a model and you water this plant. You give it data, you give it compute, and it grows. After it’s finished growing into this alien plant, you start testing it to find out what capabilities it has. It takes years to figure out, even for existing models.

Because before we even get to existential, I feel like there could be just so many brave new world type of situations. You mentioned the term, “Behavioral drift.” It’s the slow boiling that I’m really concerned about as we give our lives over to automation, that our minds can become controlled by governments, by companies, or just in a distributed way. There’s a drift. Some aspect of our human nature gives ourselves over to the control of AI systems and they, in an unintended way just control how we think. Maybe there’ll be a herd-like mentality in how we think, which will kill all creativity and exploration of ideas, the diversity of ideas, or much worse. So it’s true, it’s true."

There’s so much exciting development in AI, and to ground it in the existential risks is really, really important. Humans love to create stuff, and we should be careful not to destroy ourselves in the process. So thank you for doing that really important work."

And now let me leave you with some words from Frank Herbert in Dune. “I must not fear. Fear is the mind killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone, there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”hank you for listening and hope to see you next time."

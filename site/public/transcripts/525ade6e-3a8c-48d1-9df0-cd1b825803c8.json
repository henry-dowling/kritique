If the black holes move around, the curves have to follow them, right? But they can’t travel faster than the speed of light either. So what happens is black holes, let’s say move around, maybe I’ve got two black holes in orbit around each other, that can happen. It takes a while. A wave is created in the actual shape of space, and that wave follows the black holes as black holes are undulating. Eventually those two black holes will merge. And as we were talking about, it doesn’t take an infinite time, even though there’s time dilation because they’re both so big, they’re really deforming spacetime a lot. I don’t have a little tiny marble falling across an event horizon. I have two event horizons, and in the simulations you can see a bobble and they merge together and they make one bigger black hole."

Beautiful stuff. And it emits E equals MC squared energy. So the mass of the final black hole will be less than the sum of the two starter black holes. And that energy is radiated away in this ringing of spacetime. It’s really important to emphasize that it’s not light. None of this has to do literally with light that we can detect with normal things that detect light. X-rays, form of light, gamma rays are a form of light, infrared, optical. This whole electromagnetic spectrum, none of it is emitted as light. It’s completely dark."

So when black holes were first proposed, Einstein was very surprised that such a solution could be found so quickly, but really thought nature would protect us from their formation. And then nature thinks of a way. Nature thinks a way to make these crazy objects, which is to kill off a few stars. But then I think that there’s a confusion that dead stars, these very, very massive stars that die, are synonymous with the phenomenon of black hole. And it’s really not the case. Black holes are more general and more fundamental than just the death state of a star. But even the history of how people realize that stars could form black holes is quite fascinating because the entire idea really just started as a thought experiment."

And it’s World War I, And he gets a message from the eastern front from a friend of his, Karl Schwarzschild, who solved Einstein’s equations between sitting in the trenches and cannon fire, it was joked that he was calculating ballistic trajectories. He’s also perusing the proceedings of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, as you do. And he was an astronomer who had enlisted in his forties. And he finds this really remarkable solution to Einstein’s equations. And it’s the first exact solution. He doesn’t call it a black hole, it’s not called a black hole for decades. But what I love about what Schwarzschild did is it’s a thought experiment. It’s not about observations, it’s not about making these things in nature."

Don’t ask how that’s done, because that’s really absurd, but let’s just pretend and let’s just imagine that that’s a scenario.” And then he wants to decide what happens to spacetime if I set up this confounding, but somehow very simple scenario. And really what Einstein’s equations were telling everybody at the time was that matter and energy, curved space and time, and then curved spacetime tells matter and energy how to fall once the spacetime is shaped. So he finds this beautiful solution. And the most amazing thing about a solution is he finds this demarcation, which is the event horizon, which is the region beyond which not even light can escape. And if you were to ask me today, all these decade, over a hundred years later, I would say that is the black hole."

It’s actually in this case, a surface in spacetime. And it marks a separation in events, which is why it’s called an event horizon. Everything outside is causally separated from the inside, insofar as what’s inside the event horizon can’t affect events outside. What’s outside can affect events inside. I can throw a probe into a black hole and cause something to happen on the inside. But the opposite isn’t true. Somebody who fell in can’t send a probe out.

And this was a very big surprise, even though Einstein accepted that this was a true prediction, he didn’t think that they’d be made.

But actually what happens, these very massive stars, they’re burning thermonuclear fuel. There are earth fault of thermonuclear fuel they’re burning, and emitting energy and E equals MC squared energy. So it’s fusing, it’s a fusion bomb. It’s a constantly going thermonuclear bomb, and eventually it’s going to run out of fuel. It’s going to run out of hydrogen, helium stuff to fuse. It hits an iron core. Iron, to go past iron with fusion is actually energetically expensive, so it’s no longer going to do that so easily. So suddenly it’s run out of fuel. And if the star is very, very, very massive, much more massive than our sun, maybe 20, 30 times the mass of our sun, it’ll collapse under its own weight.

Literally electrons get jammed into the protons and make this giant nucleus in this superconducting matter, very strange, amazing object.

He thought it was too simplistic, too idealized a setup that they had used, and that if you looked at something that was more realistic and more complicated, that it just simply, it just would go away. And in fact, he draws the opposite conclusion. And there’s a story that Oppenheimer was sitting outside of the auditorium when Wheeler was coming forth with his declaration that in fact, black holes were the likely end state of gravitational collapse for very, very heavy stars.

It was really understanding the threat of Europe, what was going on in Europe and what that life.

Right now, I’ve completely rotated left, out. If I just want to draw a kind of compass diagram, not a compass diagram, but at the top of maps there’s a north, south, east, west, but now time is up down and one direction of space is let’s say east-west. As you approach the black hole, it’s as though you’re rotating in space-time is one way of thinking about it. What is the effect of that? The effect of that is as this astronaut gets closer and closer to the event horizon, part of their space is rotated into my time and part of their time is rotated into my space. In other words, their clocks seem to be less aligned with my time. The overall effect is that their time seems to dilate the spacing between ticks on the clock of their watch, let’s say on the face of their watch, is elongated, dilated, relative to mine."

My plants come and go, they die. I age faster. I’ve got gray hair and they’re falling in and it’s been minutes in their frame of reference. Flowers in their little rocket ship haven’t rotted. They don’t have gray hair. Their biological clocks have slowed down relative to ours. Eventually at the event horizon, it’s so extreme, it’s so slow, it’s as other clocks have stopped altogether from my point of view. That’s to say that it’s as though their time is completely rotated into my space. This is connected with the idea that inside the black hole space and time have switched places.

Nobody can really visualize it, but we know mathematically how to unpack it on paper. I can mathematically suppress one of the spatial dimensions and then I can draw it pretty well.

Everything on the right-hand side of Einstein’s equations is how matter and energy are distributed in space-time. On the left-hand side tells you how space and time deform in response to that matter and energy, and it can be impossible to solve some of those equations. What was so amazing about what Schwarzschild did is he found this very elegant, simple solution within a month of reading this final formulation, but Einstein didn’t go through and try to find all the solutions.

I can solve for the shape of the space-time.” I can also say, “Well, what if the universe is full of gas or light and it’s all kind of uniform everywhere.” I’ll find a different equally surprising solution, which is that the universe would expand in response to that, that it’s not static, that the distances between galaxies would grow.

Here, this is saying that if I’m racing at a light beam and you’re standing still relative to the source, we’ll measure the same exact speed of light. Very strange. He gets to relativity by saying, “Well, what speed? Speed is distance. It’s space over time. It’s how far you travel. It’s the space you travel in a certain duration of time.” He said, “Well, I bet something must be wrong then with space and time.” This is an enormous leap.

He did something remarkable, Newton did, with his theory of gravity, just understanding that the same phenomenon was at work with the earth around the sun as the apple falling from the tree. That’s insane. That’s a huge leap. Understanding that mass, inertial mass, what makes something hard to push around is the same thing that feels gravity, at least in the Newtonian picture, in that simple way. Unbelievable leap. Absolutely genius, but he didn’t like that the apple fell from the tree, even though the earth wasn’t touching it."

And there’s something flawless about black holes that makes them fundamental, unlike anything else. So they’re flawless in the sense that you can completely understand a black hole by looking at just its electric charge, its mass and its spin. And every black hole with that charge mass and spin is identical to every other black hole. You can’t be like, “Oh, that one’s mine, I recognize it. It has this little feature and that’s how I know it’s mine.” They’re featureless. You try to put Mount Everest on a black hole and it will shake it off in these gravitational waves.

That’s what it means to be an electron. There’s no electron that’s a little bit different. You can’t recognize your electron. They’re all identical in that sense. And so in some very abstract way, black holes share something in common with microscopic fundamental particles. And so what they tell us about the fundamental laws of physics can be very profound, and it’s why even theoretical physicists, mathematical physicists, not just astronomers who use telescopes, they rely on the black hole as a terrain to perform their thought experiments, and it’s because there’s something fundamental about them."

When he was a young researcher, he was thinking about black holes and wanted to just add a little smidge of quantum mechanics, just a little smidge. Wasn’t going for full-blown quantum gravity, but just asking, “Well, what if I allowed this nothing, this vacuum, this empty space around the event horizon, the stars gone, there’s nothing there, what if I allowed it to possess ordinary quantum properties, just a little tiny bit, nothing dramatic? Don’t go crazy.” And one of the properties of the vacuum that is intriguing is this idea that you can never see the vacuums actually completely empty. We talked about Heisenberg, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle really kicked off a lot of quantum mechanical thinking, it says that you can never exactly know a particle’s position simultaneously with its motion, with its momentum. You can know one or the other pretty precisely, but not both precisely."

In some sense, when it’s in a precise location, it is fundamentally no longer in a precise motion. And that uncertainty principle means I can’t precisely say a particle is exactly here, but it also means I can’t say it’s not. And so it led to this idea that what do I mean by a vacuum? Because I can’t 100% precisely know. In fact, there’s not really meaningful to say that there’s zero particles here. And so what you can say however, is you can say, “Well, maybe particles froth around in this seething quantum sea of the vacuum. Maybe two particles come into existence and they’re entangled in such a way that they cancel out each other’s properties so they have the properties of the vacuum. They don’t destroy the properties of the vacuum. They cancel out each other, spin maybe, each other’s charge maybe, things like that, but they froth around. They come, they go, they come, they go.”"

Now, they can both fall in, that’s okay, but if one falls in and the other doesn’t, it’s stuck. It can’t go back into the vacuum because now it has a charge or it has a spin or it has something that’s no longer the property of that vacuum it came from, it needs its pair to disappear.

It came from the vacuum. It stole it from empty space, from the nothingness that is the black hole. Now, the reason why this is very tricky is because in the process, because of the separation on other side of the event horizon, the particle it absorbs, it has to do with the switching of space and time that we talked about, but the particle, it absorbs, well, from the outside you might say, “Oh, it had negative momentum.

It’s going to be the most informationless possibility you could possibly come up with when you’re radiating particles. It’s just going to look like a thermal distribution of particles like a hot body. And the temperature is going to only tell you about the mass, which you could tell from outside the black hole anyway, you know the mass of the black hole from the outside.

It does not allow quantum information to simply evaporate away and poof out of the universe and cease to exist.

So we don’t see black holes evaporate, they’re way too big. But as they get smaller and smaller, they get hotter and hotter. So as a black hole nears the end of this cycle, of evaporating away, it takes a very long time, much longer than the age of the universe. It will be as though the current and the event horizon is yanked up, it’ll literally explode away, just boom. And the event horizon in principle would be yanked up, everything’s gone.

So the idea is, well, therefore, I can know nothing about what goes into the black hole, so the information is lost. But if they could have hair, I could say that’s my black hole, because it’ll have features that I could distinguish and it could encode the information that went in this way.

It was like an intuition that they had landed on and now are trying to formalize. But to take a step back, one way of thinking about ER equals EPR, you have to talk about holography first. And holography both Juan Maldacena really formalized it, Lenny Susskind suggested it. The idea of a black hole hologram is that all of the information in the black hole, whatever it is, whatever entropy as a measure of information, whatever the entropy of the black hole is, which is telling you how much information is hidden in there, how much information you don’t have direct access to, in some sense, is completely encoded in the area of the black hole."

So Lenny coined this a hologram. People who take it very seriously say, “Well, again, maybe the interior of the black hole just doesn’t exist. It’s a holographic projection of this two-dimensional surface.” In fact, maybe I should take it all the way and say so are we.

They exposed flaws in these kind of approaches, and it actually reinvigorated the campaign to find a solution. So it stopped it from stalling.

Actually, something much more dramatic. Gravity is just emerging from this quantum description. That gravity isn’t fundamental. And what is the only thing that we have when we go rock bottom, when we go deeper and deeper, smaller and smaller is quantum mechanics. So all of this, space-time looks nice and smooth and continuous, but if I look at the quantum realm I’ll see everything sewn together out of quantum threads.

To get something going on in gravity, I need big objects and things like black holes. So the idea is if black holes curve space and time around them in the way that we’ve been describing, things fall along the curves in space. If the black holes move around, the curves have to follow them, right? But they can’t travel faster than the speed of light either.

And in the simulations, you can see it bobble and they merge together, and they make one bigger black hole, and then it radiates in the gravitational waves.

To think about that, how wild that is, that even a fact about numbers seems very simple, could be true, and unprovable, could never exist as a theorem, for instance, in mathematics, unreachable. This incompleteness result was very disturbing. Essentially, it’s equivalent to saying there’s no theory of everything for mathematics. It was very disturbing to people, but it was very profound.

I don’t know if people feel as strongly about Hurricane Sandy as New Yorkers do, but it was a real moment around 2012, 2013, sort of paused the project, and you can even see the kind of waterline on the brick of where Sandy was. I came in and collided with these two shortly after that, and it really was like a collision. I’m science, they’re art. Gabe makes everything, builds everything with his bare hands. Dustin’s a dreamer. They love science. They really wanted science, but science is hard to access. I have always loved the translation of science in literature, in art. I love fiction writers, really literary fiction writers who dabble thinking about science, and I very firmly believe science is part of culture. I know it to be true. I don’t think of myself as doing outreach or education. I don’t like those labels. I’m doing culture, an artist in their studio working out problems, understanding materials, building the body of work."

So we plume exploded. Pioneer Works became science and art. It’s not artists who all do science, or scientists who do art. It’s real, hardcore scientists talking about science in a lot of live events. We have a magazine called Broadcast where we feature all of the disciplines rubbing together, artists working on all kinds of things. When I first started doing events there, my first guest, like you, I was talking to people, and [inaudible 02:50:10] was like, “I know how to talk to people because I know these guys,” and I’ve been on the interviewee side so much. I know exactly. It was fully formed, for me, how to do those conversations."

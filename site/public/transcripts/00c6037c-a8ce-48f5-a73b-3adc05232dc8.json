We shoot that opening sequence, incredible opening sequence and the visual Look, we’ve never seen that. I want to just take this and make it move. I just want the comic to move. Any other studio would just go make it look like any gritty crime movie, and they would miss the point that the visual is half of it. I want it to look just like this because it would be the boldest movie anyone’s seen because that’s how it reads when I read the book. It’s like, if this was moving, it would be the most phenomenal movie. Just by being around him and working with him you get by osmosis, you learn stuff and it just ups your game because they’re just swing way beyond you."

I was about to go do Desperado and I went, “Hey, I just took a three-day Steadicam course because I can’t afford a Steadicam operator, so I’m going to operate Steadicam myself on Desperado.” Now if he was just my peer, he’d say, “Oh, I did the same thing,” and I’m going to do the same thing. That would be hanging out with somebody of your I, but you want somebody who’s above that. Do you know what he said? He goes, “I bought about a Steadicam, but not to operate it. I’m going to take it apart and design a better one. Us mere mortals trying to learn how to operate the camera. He’s designing all new systems. That’s the guy you want to hang out with, not someone who’s doing what you’re doing."

When you see the city, we put a blue screen way in the back to just make the city keep going, but we built the sets there, the town, we built the real set. So everything was very tangible and real, and that way she had to fit into that world and be as real as that because if it was all done in CG, well then now you can fudge everything. But if you put her in a real environment, that’s a real challenge. And just like with our movies, you watch it all fall apart, you watch this thing blow up, you watch this thing not work, everything just falls apart in front of your face. Then that’s when you roll up your sleeves and creatively figure out a way around it and by the end, you have a result that’s better than what you sought out. Sift through the ashes of your failure and you’ll find the key to your next success is in there. But if you’re not looking for it, you don’t find it."

    "text": "The following is a conversation with Robert Rodriguez, a legendary filmmaker and creator of Sin City, El Mariachi, Desperado, Spy Kids, Machete from Dust Till Dawn, Alita, Battle Angel, The Faculty, and many more. Robert inspired a generation of independent filmmakers with his first film, El Mariachi, that he famously made for just $7,000. On that film in many sense, he was not only the director, he was also the writer, producer, cinematographer, editor, visual effects supervisor, sound designer, composer, basically the full stack of filmmaking. He has shown incredible versatility across genres including action horror, family films and sci-fi with some epic collaborations with Quentin Tarantino, James Cameron, and many other legendary actors and filmmakers. He has often operated at the technological cutting edge, pioneering, using HD filmmaking, digital backlots and 3D tech, and always through all of that, he’s been a champion of independent filmmaking, running his own studio here in Austin, Texas, which in many ways is very far away from Hollywood."

Then when they’re further away and it’s safer, then we’ll do the big fireballs.” So we’re going and you’re nervous if one of them trips up a line and the pressure’s on them, it’s not just you that’s nervous, you’re nervous for them.

It just went like this, I felt it go whack all the way out of focus and whack for a second back. It just reset itself. We don’t know why it did that because it’s radio-controlled and we can’t tell because we’re shooting film. So we’re like, “Oh, shit. Let’s watch the dailies. Sure enough, let’s see if we can, maybe I can scratch the film right there.” No, it goes completely out focus and back in focus within a second. Now we got to res-hoot it.

It blew out, you see it in the movie. You see this huge fireball going up and if you watch closely, you see it already start to catch the whole place on fire. The whole front of that, which is foam, is catching on fire, and I cut just before you see that it’s on fire, and that was the first shot at that bar because we weren’t going to start shooting the other stuff till night."

Guys came out with the fire hoses. The fire hoses weren’t even any water. The thing was just scorching.

That’s why that whole scene with George Clooney and Cheech and the building’s black, we didn’t go over there and touch that up. That’s real flame that burned and it ended up looking great. So then the next week when we came back to shoot that other shot that didn’t work, we came back and they had repaired it and we shot all the night stuff, which is the majority of the stuff in front of it. So sometimes you got to roll with it and look at the blessing you get because of there’s a mistake. You probably actually got a better take by doing it later with them. And then you had this incredible look for the end of the movie that looked apocalyptic. If it had looked just clean, you would’ve actually seen that it was kind of a foam set. This made it look better. So I kind of let the universe push you where you’re supposed to go."

We have a pitbull, we have a turtle, we’ve got a bus that Carlos’ cousin owns. His brother-in-law has a bar and he owns a ranch. So the bad guy lives at the ranch. The fight scene’s going to be in the bar. He’s going to hit a bus at one point, the girl’s going to have a dog and a turtle is going to cross the road.

But I thought if someone actually picks it up and has the balls to watch this thing, they’re going to be surprised. I put a lot of action in. It was just to learn from, I just needed to make it for as little as possible, see how much I could sell it for. If I could double my money, great. I can make another one and just get more practice. It was just, I was so intrigued by this idea. You’ve heard advice about screenwriting. I heard a revise back then that I thought was ridiculous. It said, “It’s going to take you a long time to be a good screenwriter. So write three scripts and throw them away. The fourth script will be the good one.” I was like, it’s so hard."

Wouldn’t it be better if you write three scripts and then shoot each one and be the cameraman, be the sound guy, be everything? Because that way you’re learning, not just writing, you’re learning how to make a movie. So that was my idea. I’m going to make three of these, hide it on Spanish video, but make money back.

You didn’t know all that stuff… I couldn’t have figured all that out in advance.

I picked this diverse group of filmmakers, gave them $7,000, and we documented them making a feature two weeks like I did. You can bring one person. I had Carlos Gallardo, the producer and star of Mariachi, “Bring one person, can be your cameraman or you can be your sound guy, whatever. But it’s only that for the shoot and you’d have to do the whole thing.” And I saw those guys by the time they’re like, “I don’t know how we’re going to make this movie.” By the first week of shooting, they’re already talking about their next feature.

You leave the set and you come back and you’re all excited.” and I go, “No, we’re painting. We’re painting. But that makes sense that you say that because when you get your creativity firing, it’s more powerful than any drug.” And we would come back and he’d be on the set going, “Is it bad that I’m still thinking about the painting?” And I’m like, “No, I think it’s good.

We came in and the table was like this and they said, we have a problem.

Would you like us to make you a film for you to sell your headsets?” So yeah, they gave us a budget. They’re dying for content. They gave us a budget.

Every movie has to have a ticking clock. So the audience knows this story’s not just going to take over a period of years though. Suddenly someone in the movie around 20 or 30 minutes in will say, “We’ve got to go find the groom before the wedding this weekend.” It’ll be just like that."

Because they already know how to be a persona, be on stage, be in front of a bunch of people, which most actors can’t do. And she said, “Actually I studied acting before I became a singer.” Said, “Well, you’ll never be able to be in a movie, because you know what? They don’t know how to shoot people out. They’ll want six months of your time, and you’re always on tour. But if you come, be here, I have a part for you. I can shoot you out in half a day, this whole section of a movie, and I’ll shoot your movie poster.”"

Getting the best performances, getting the best meat, getting the best ingredients. Right? Editing is like the cooking. Too much of this, and not enough of that, you fuck the whole thing up. So, so many filmmakers do not edit, and they give it to some other guy. Who might look at all your ingredients and go, “Well, this is all great, but I’m going to go make a fucking souffle.” And he makes something else."

So they’re getting the wrong stuff, they’re having to reshoot shit. The editor is in a room somewhere, useless. Calling after the fact, “We still need to get this close up,” or, “You got to reshoot that, because it doesn’t match,” because no one knows editing. So if you just know that, you’re already miles ahead of 99% of Hollywood. But that’s just how I learn, by accident, so I kind of stumbled upon it.

And I used all gun sounds for the sounds of the key, instead of key sounds, because it wasn’t sound closeup enough.

We have ideas on how to do it because it was always built to be a trilogy and he sees that there’s a lot of love for it. It was just weird because it was Fox movie and they got bought by Disney and then so they weren’t really making Fox movies because they had enough work with their Disney movies, but now they’re starting to make some Fox movies like they did Deadpool and some Fox movies are starting to get made, so time might be right for us to come back and do Alita."

My 3D is not like the kind they have in theaters where it’s very polite. Mine’s like theme park 3D where kids aren’t doing like that trying to grab, that’s why it was such a big hit. Nobody does 3D like that, but I wanted that. I wanted shit falling in people’s laps. So you go, okay, this is why I’m wearing the glasses. I’m wondering why.

I told them, “I don’t want to spend more than $50 million. I know you all want to give me 80, but I want to be a hero and come in at 50 because one, it’ll make it better. And then two, you’ll make three of them instead of just one. I don’t want to just go spend the farm.” And not many filmmakers will do that. Don’t try to get as much money as they can. But when you’re spending less, it’s a win-win situation. You have more creative freedom because they’re going to leave you alone. You can do whatever you want."

And I’m like,” Oh, well, that’s because we ran out of sun and we had to do that jump with just him jumping on a pad three times,” or whatever it is. It’s something that you fumbled together and that’s what they’re drawn to. They’re drawn to that imperfect thing. And so I wouldn’t judge it because somebody, if you called your movie, that’s like John Carpenter saying, “Yeah, nobody liked The Thing and it’s a shitty movie and everyone hated it, so it must not be good.” Then 10 years later, it’s a masterpiece."

    "text": "So when you walk out of here, it’s going to be with a complete commitment, “I’m a technical and creative person.” Like my first boss. I’m unstoppable because my boss told me that and he was right. I became technical and creative and you’re just unstoppable. You can just keep going and just go, “I’m unstoppable.” That doesn’t mean you’re going to use your powers for bad, but you’ve just changed your life by just declaring that. And I’m also a creative person who lives his life creatively. I’m going to find creative ways to use that technology. If somebody says, “You’re not the same kind of artist I was expecting,” that’s their own opinion. Don’t blink. Just keep going. All these things that you’ve learned that people were supposed to tell you along the way, they’re telling you for a reason. Anytime you got pushed, if you go back to your life at your really critical moments in your life where you went that way instead of that way, there was probably somebody there who said something to you that kind of pushed you."

    "text": "There was one guy when I was in high school. It was senior year. I wrote a paper. And I wasn’t a great writer at all. I wrote a paper for a Latin American studies class, gave it to the teacher and he said, “Wow, you’re going to be rich and famous in four years based on what I read.” I was like, “Really?” I’m 17 or 18. Four years later, I did Mariachi and I went to him later at a reunion and I said, “You called it. You said I was going to be… Why did you say that?” And he was like, “I said that? I [inaudible 03:26:49].” He looked like he would never say that to somebody. You’d think he would own it and say, “Oh yeah, I knew and I told you.” No. He looked like he didn’t even know who I was. He was acting like he never would’ve said that in a million years. So again, sometimes things come out of our mouth that’s not us, that comes through us. So if you think of it that way, why are we here? We’re here for a reason. We’re going to get nudged along. Listen to the signs. Own who you’re supposed to be because you are that person. Don’t let your human doubt get in the way. That’s like the guy closing the pipe. “I don’t know if I’m really creative. I don’t know if I’m really a businessman.” And you’re just closing the pipe. You’re not going to let it flow. Just be a good pipe. Just say, “I just want to be a good pipe. Clean, open.” And then that’s when the magic happens."

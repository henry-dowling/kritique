For each guest, I hope to explore their life’s work, life’s story, and what and how they think, and do so honestly and fully, the good, the bad, and the ugly, the brilliance and the flaws. I won’t whitewash their sins, but I won’t reduce them to a worse possible caricature of their sins either. The latter is what the mass hysteria of internet mobs too often does, often rushing to a final judgment before the facts are in. I will try to do better than that, to respect due process in service of the truth, and I hope to have the courage to always think independently and to speak honestly from the heart, even when the eyes of the outraged mob are on me."

Would it be imposing to say, can I read it again? Because it’s been a while now, and I’d like to.” So they sent a script over. I read the script that night. I thought about it, and I had this feeling, I can’t even quite describe it, but I had this feeling that it would be really good if I didn’t take billing in the film, and the reason I felt that was because I knew that by the time this film would come out, it would be the last one of the three movies that I’d just shot, the fourth one. And if any of those films broke through or did well, if it was going to be Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kevin Spacey, and you don’t show up for the first 25, 30, 40 minutes, people are going to figure out who you’re playing."

Maybe in contrast with Brad Pitt’s performance, that’s also really strong, but that in the contrast is the terrifying sense that you get in the audience, that builds up to the twist at the end, or the surprise at the end, with the famous, “What’s in the box?” from Brad Pitt, that is Brad Pitt’s character’s wife, her head."

And knowing that should allow you to have tremendous confidence,” and I just followed that lead. And I just think it’s the kind of film that so many of the elements that had been at work from the beginning of the movie, in terms of its style, in terms of how he built this terror, in terms of how he built for the audience, a sense of this person being one of the scariest people that you might ever encounter, it really allowed me to be able to not have to do that much, just say the words and mean them."

And so in the end, whether Brad Pitt’s character ends up shooting John Doe, or turning the gun on himself, which was a discussion … there were a number of alternative endings that were discussed … nothing ends up being tied up in a nice little bow.

Sam Mendes, for example, will start, he’ll start a scene and he does this wonderful thing. He brings rugs and he brings chairs and sofas in, and he says, “Well, let’s put two chairs here and here. You guys, let’s start in these chairs, far apart from each other. Let’s see what happens with the scene if you’re that far apart.” And so we’ll do the scene that way."

And then it’s a little harder in Shakespeare to improv, but in any situation where you want to try and see where … where could a scene go? Where would the scene go If I didn’t make that choice? Where would the scene go? If I made this choice? Where would the scene go if I didn’t say that, or I said something else? So that’s how improv can be a valuable process to learn about limits and boundaries, and what’s going on with a character, that somehow you discover in trying something that isn’t on the page."

And then there are other situations where they just take director’s messages. And on this one, they’re taking my messages, this is where I’m staying, make sure your people get to me. We start auditions on Thursday.” And on Thursday I had an opportunity to come in and audition for this play that I’d been working on and preparing. And at the end of it, I did four scenes. At the end of it, he said to me that unless someone else came in and blew him against the wall, I had just done as far as he was concerned, I pretty much had the part, but I couldn’t tell my agents that yet because I had to come back and read with Mr. Lemmon."

So we rehearsed it like a play in a sound stage where everything was laid out, like it would be in a play and this couch will be here. And he’d sent me a couple of tapes. He’d sent me two cassette tapes, one that he’d like to call pre-Lester before he begins to move in a new direction. And then post-Lester, and they just were different songs.

There is something called direct address. In Shakespeare you have Hamlet, talks to the world. But when Shakespeare wrote Richard III, it was the first time he created something called direct address, which is the character looks directly at each person close by. It is a different kind of sharing than when a character’s doing a monologue. Opening of Henry IV. And while there are some people who believe that direct address was invented in Ferris Bueller, it wasn’t. It was Shakespeare who invented it. So I had just had this experience every night in theaters all over the world, seeing how people reacted to becoming a co-conspirator, because that’s what it’s about. And what I tried to do and what Fincher really helped me with in those beginning days was how to look in that camera and imagine I was talking to my best friend."

They literally had to drag me from one place to another scene. “Now it’s the scene with Hastings,” but I now understand these wonderful stories that you can read in old books about Shakespeare’s time, that actors grabbed Shakespeare around the cuff and punched him and threw him against a wall and said, “You ever write a part like this again? I’m going to kill you.” And that’s why in later plays, he started to have a pageant happened, and then a wedding happened and the main character was off stage resting because the actor had said, “You can’t do this to us.

So I went in to read for this character, Brodie, who is a Scottish character. And I did the audition, and Mike Nichols comes down the aisle of the theater, and he’s asking me questions about, “Where’d you go to school?” And, “What have you been doing?” I just come back from doing a bunch of years of regional theater and different theaters, so I was in New York, and meeting Mike Nichols was just incredible. So Mr. Nichols went, “Have you seen the other play that I directed up the block called Hurlyburly?” And I said, “No, I haven’t.” And he says, “Why not?” I said, “I can’t afford a Broadway ticket.” He said, “We can arrange that. I’d like you to go see that play, and then I’d like you to come in next week and audition for that.” And I was like, “Okay.”"

And I come in and I audition for it, and Nichols says, “I want you to understudy Harvey Keitel, and I want you to understudy Phil.” And I’m like, “Phil?” I mean, Harvey Keitel is in his forties, he looks like he can beat the shit out of everybody on stage, I’m this 24-year-old.

Anyway, one day I get a call, “You’re going on today as Phil.” So I went on, Nichols is told by Peter Lawrence who’s the stage manager, “Spacey’s gone on as Phil.” So Nichols comes down and watches the second act, comes backstage, he says, “That was really good, how soon could you learn Mickey?” Mickey was the role that Ron Silver was playing that Chris Walken also played. I said, “I don’t know, maybe a couple weeks.” He goes, “Learn Mickey too.” So I learned Mickey, and then one day I’m told, “You’re going on tomorrow night as Mickey.”"

And I was so nervous I literally couldn’t wink, Nichols had to calm me down and help me wink. But that became my very first film. And he was incredible, and he let me come and watch when they were shooting scenes I wasn’t in. And I remember ending up one day in the makeup trailer, on the same day we were working, Jack and Me, we had no scene together. But I remember him coming in, and they put him down in the chair, and they put frozen cucumbers on his eyes, and did his neck, and then they raised him up and did his face.

But there’s a moment in episode one where President Walker broke his promise to Frank Underwood that he would make him the Secretary of State. Was this when the monster in Frank was born or was the monster always there? For you looking at that character, was there an idealistic notion to him that there’s loyalty and that broke him?

I never had a sense that I was loved, and that stayed with me my whole life. And when I think back at who my father was, and more succinctly who he became, it was a gradual, and slow, and sad development. When I’ve gone back, and now I’ve looked at diaries my father kept and albums he kept, particularly when he was a medic in the US Army, served our country with distinction. When the war was over and they went to Germany, the things my father said, the things that he wrote, the things that he believed were as patriotic as any American soldier who had ever served. But then when he came back to America and he had a dream of being a journalist, or his big hope was that he was going to be the great American novelist, he wanted to be a creative novelist, and so he sat in his office and he wrote for 45 years and never published anything. And somewhere along the way, in order to make money, he became what they call a technical procedure writer. Which the best way to describe that is that if you built the F-16 aircraft, my father would have written the manual to tell you how to do it.

And thank God for my sister who said, “Don’t listen to a thing he says, he’s out of his mind.” And even though I was young, I knew everything he was saying was against people, and I loved people. I had so many wonderful friends, my best friend Mike, who’s still my close friend to this day, I was afraid to bring him to my house because I was afraid that my father would find out he was Jewish, or that my father would leave his office door open and someone would see his Nazi flag, or his pictures of Hitler, or Nazi books, or what he might say.

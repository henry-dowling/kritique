And so people in the world have extraordinarily detailed expectations of a face and we can notice imperfections, especially perfections arising from computer graphics limitations. Okay, one part is capturing humans and so [inaudible 00:00:33] really advanced, dedicated hardware that puts a human in a capture sphere with dozens of cameras in them taking high resolution, high frame rate video of them as they go through a range of motions. And then capturing the human face is complicated because the nuanced detail of our faces and how all the muscles and sinews and fat work together to give us different expressions."

There’s a lot of other problems with computer graphics. There’s technology for rendering hair, which is really hard. Because you can’t render every… Again, we know the laws of physics. It would be easy to just render every hair. It would just be a billion times too slow. So you need approximations that capture the net effect of hair on rendering and on pixels without calculating every single interaction of every light with every strand of hair. That’s one part of it. There’s detailed features for different parts of faces. There’s subsurface scattering because we think of humans as opaque, but really our skin, light travels through it. It’s not completely opaque, and the way in which light travels through skin has a huge impact on our appearance."

I think I heard that sort of the oiliness of the skin creates very specific, nuanced, complex reflections and then some light is absorbed and travels through the skin and that creates textures that our human eye is able to perceive and it creates the thing that we consider human, whatever that is. All of that, while considering all the muscles involved in making the nuanced expression, just the subtle squinting of the eyes or the subtle formation of a smile, it’s the subtlety of human faces that you have to capture, like the difference between a real smile and a fake smile, but the way to show beginning of a formation of a smile that actually reveals a deep sadness, all of that, when I watch a human face, I can read that. I could see that you have to have the tools that, in real time, can render something like that, and that’s incredibly difficult."

It was my first trip away from my family just to hang out with him and he had this brand new IBM computer and I learned to program over the course of a few days in BASIC.

Every step and every challenge, there were lessons learned, some of which I’ve come to realize were just like me getting over some learning hurdles. But other things were actually shortcomings of programming languages and the realization that there are actually better ways than what a programmer is learning to program for their first time. A lot of what they’re facing isn’t the challenge of learning a new art. It’s friction introduced by failures of programming language design. And so I’ve constantly come back to those early lessons there as I’ve progressed and done more and more things including building programming languages."

That was my very first game. It took about a couple hours to build and tune, and I went from there. But I built a lot of things. I built databases at different points. I built a programming language and a full compiler for a language like Pascal because I didn’t know where you went to buy one of those. So I made my own.

And I didn’t do this with a great amount of structure or planning. I was rather just going from project to project, doing things that I thought would be fun and cool. And with each project I learned new things, learning about how to store and manage data, learning how to deal with advanced data structures, how to write complex programs that have deeply nested data and control flow. Each one of those provide a lesson which were later essential. In 1991, I released my first game and over the course of that decade went from zero commercial releases to the first generation Unreal Engine. But this was largely just using the knowledge that I’d built up over the previous decade, just doing fun hobby projects.

And yeah, I wasn’t really sure how engineers would actually make use of that knowledge. Do you just forget about it when you actually go off to do work or do you write down equations on paper? It was actually not clear as an early engineering student what you do, but when I started writing the first generation Unreal Engine and I was dealing with 3DMS, I was like, wait, I know this stuff. I learned this. And so suddenly like the karate kid, you get to paint the fence and wax the car and suddenly put all the pieces together into a 3D engine based on a whole lot of accumulated programming language and math knowledge, often knowledge gained without ever anticipating that I might use it in that way."

But it turns out eigenvectors and eigenvalues were the critical breakthrough that made the Google search engine technology work and stand apart from the rest because they found if you threw all the links that exist into the web and links from and to different sites and you put them in a giant matrix and you conclude it, you found a dominant eigenvalues."

It was like you move this dot around the screen and picked up objects like swords and fought dragons and invaded castles and solved puzzles. Very, very simple iconic stuff rather than realistic graphics. And then the other game that I really got immersed in was Zork, which was a text adventure game. It would tell you where you are and what you see and you type in commands like go north or pick up sword or open door and explore a world that way.

And 30 years later, I still run into people when I go to a game industry event, it was like I grew up playing ZZT and here’s an adult who grew up playing my game. And it was because it enabled anybody to become a creator too. It had this old board editor and it also had a little scripting language, so you could learn a little bit of programming in it too. And it kind of impressed, and it really set a formative principle of Epic, which was that the company’s mission is to make awesome entertainment, but also awesome tools and to share those tools with everybody so that they can build their own amazing things too."

We’ve been able to survive every financial downturn, and sometimes the engine’s been funding the business because we didn’t have a game. And sometimes the games have been funding the business.

Back in the 1990s, Epic was new, but Electronic Arts and Activision and the other big publishers had been around for a decade, and they were huge companies. It had giant retail distribution networks. If I tried to make a game and then convinced them to publish it, I doubt I could have had a chance. And I doubt that even if I had made a successful game, that I would’ve made much money from it, though they might have. And so the really unique angle to Epic then was shareware. And that was just the idea that if we distribute our game differently, then we can reach a much larger audience than these bigger competitors by virtue of this first episode of the game being free."

So the other lesson there was just minimize the friction of people getting into your game, make it easy to get into and make it fun. I think the other, well, I was very fortunate. ZZT was a funny game. It was not much like any other game.

It was the fact that I released an editor and there was a whole community around it. And you see that trend has repeated itself, like there was, ZZT was one of it. Before that, there was Bill Budge’s Pinball construction set. That was a 1980s Apple game that let users build their own pinball tables.

A much better chance of success is in releasing something that hasn’t been done before. Being really unique and reaching an audience, even if big or medium size or small, reaching an audience and becoming really popular with that, making some money from it, and being able to reinvest and then expand towards your ultimate dream.

Because at the time Quake had shipped it had a little bit of dynamic lighting, Unreal really pushed dynamic lighting much higher than anybody else had done before, using colored dynamic lights with some shadow casting capabilities statically or moving lights without shadows and figured out how to do a volumetric fog so you could have foggy areas that were full of lights and you get the kind of glow of the lights standing out in the fog and affecting the appearance of the level."

And so at that point I realized actually spending money on getting good equipment was a good investment. And we’re not talking about millions of dollars here or billions if you’re building a GPU farm, we’re just talking about buying some basic hardware.

It could run up to two instructions a time. And if you wrote your assembly code very carefully, you could get absolute maximum throughput. So I’d gotten my texture mapping code down to six CPU cycles, comprising 11 instructions, and that was required for every pixel on the screen, and that was just enough performance to deliver that. But Dell came out with these new workstations and Intel had just launched the Pentium Pro, the first out of order processor.

How many instructions do you need to run to get a pixel on screen? And so there was a constant challenge to optimize that down. And there was also a competition among all of the graphics programmers who’d often send emails bragging to each other about what new technique they’ve discovered to try to get the cost down.

Basically, you want to render an image that’s indistinguishable from the full detailed geometry, if you rendered it, at ridiculous cost. And so the challenge is how to simplify every component of the rendering, the geometry, the lighting, and so on down to real time techniques. They’re efficient. they capture a realistic view of what’s around you. And so when an object is up close to you, you want to render it with a lot more polygons than when it’s far away. But one of the cool principles of mathematics is the Nyquist sampling theorem that says if you’re trying to reconstruct a signal, there’s a limit to the amount of data you need to bother capturing. If you want to render a texture at a certain resolution, then you never need more than twice the pixels than in the texture that you have on the screen. And that’s called the Nyquist limit."

And with geometry, the idea is that if you render two triangles per pixel, you should get an image that is indistinguishable from thousands of triangles per pixel. If you render less than two triangles per pixel, you’re going to start to see visible artifacts of the loss."

And one of the limits of GPUs is that the triangle rasterizers are built for pretty large triangles. If you’re building a triangle or rendering a triangle with 10 pixels, that’s pretty efficient. But if you’re building or rendering a triangle with one pixel, it’s very inefficient. So one of the breakthroughs Brian made was to design an entire pipeline for avoiding the rasterization hardware in the GPU and just going straight to pixels and calculating what should be done with that pixel as a result of some ray tracing and geometry intersection calculations done in a pixel shader. So instead of using the triangle pipeline, we’re just using pixel pipeline."

The human eye and the human focus and the human attention mechanism defines how much detail you want to show because the thing that the human is likely to be giving attention to, you want that to be super high resolution and everything else, including due to distance, can have less geometry and less texture, less information in it."

And so we had this revenue stream funding the development of Unreal Engine from other games that were being built by other developers. And because they were the lifeline for the company, we took the engine business very seriously from the start. We set up mailing lists so that our partners could ask us questions. And all the developers and artists working on our games were participating in helping customers. Everybody took that very seriously because it was our funding source.

If you want to build a door, then you need to add like a dozen different pieces of door frames and add a bunch of different walls together to fit together in the right shape. It sure would be easier if you could just start with a wall and subtract the door out.

Carmack had figured out how to do really cool lighting algorithms, including real-time lighting with objects moving around, and I hadn’t taken it very far. With Unreal Engine, I realized we don’t have nearly enough computing performance on our CPU to compute the light of every pixel on the screen from all of the light sources that affect it. Yeah, we were at a six-cycle texture mapper and we couldn’t afford 30 more cycles for lighting, and so the answer had to be some approximation. The one that Carmack had picked up on in the quake engine was lightmapping. If we, instead of calculating all the lighting on every pixel, what if we made a big texture that we placed over all of the walls in the scene that was wallpaper, and what if we say at every foot, we’re going to compute a lighting value for just that one foot grid on the object rather than computing it everywhere. Then, well, if we just linear interpolate that over the course of it, get a lighting solution that actually works pretty well and is fast enough to work. A lot of Unreal Engine’s lighting techniques were based on lightmapping. We introduced colored lighting, so you could have colored light sources. Then we realized, “Oh, since we’re doing this and we’re doing it on light maps, we can actually do some pretty expensive calculations, hundreds of cycles since we’re only calculating it for every one foot of world space rather than every pixel.”"

I created a system for compositing them together. If you had an arbitrary number of light sources, they could all do that. Then I implemented a shadowing algorithm. If you cast a ray from a light to a point on a surface and see whether it intersects any other geometry, if it doesn’t intersect, then the light hits the object. If it does intersect, then the light hits something else first and that pixel on the object should be dark. I built a real-time version of this and it ran at about a half a frame a second. I was running around at half a frame a second, shooting out light projectiles and looking at dynamic lighting, and it was like, someday computers will be fast enough for this, but not today. I made a non-real-time version that pre-calculates all the lighting and realized, “Oh wait, if you pre-calculated the shadowing on an object, you can still apply the lighting dynamically as long as the light’s not moving.” You could do torch flickering with shadows and figured out all the cases of dynamic and static lighting that were actually practical on a computer at the time and expose them to artists. This was the wonderful thing. I was just typing in these old features, exposing them to artists, and every day they’d find like a dropdown with some more lighting options available to them, and they’d start using them and they’d do things that I never thought possible."

I had to realize that the way the fog interacted with the light was that you calculate the view from your eye’s position to a point on a surface in the world.

Then I looked in a reference book of all the integrals, and thankfully people have solved them all. I realized the integral of this transformed one over R-squared turns out to be solved by the arc tangent of R. If you calculate some parameters based on the position of the eye and the position of the surface point you’re ultimately seeing, then you calculate exactly how much fog you can accumulate from that. Of course, you can’t do that per pixel because that’s hundreds of cycles on CPU time. What we had to do is calculate volumetric fog on something equivalent to a light map, but calculating fog every square meter in the world. We had enough performance for that, built volumetric lighting and gave it to the artists and they started building magically detailed levels with volumetric fog in real time. Then decades later, I was talking to one of the engineers who’d worked on that hardware and asked about their volumetric fog and told them how it inspired me to figure out how to do it in real time myself.

The Lumen lighting system that’s powering the scene is doing different kinds of lighting calculations at different scales. This was the work of Daniel Wright following a decade of moving the state-of-the-art of lighting forward. His theory, which was rather controversial at the time, was that if you have enough levels of lighting calculation, then you can get everything global illumination working everywhere from the absolute highest levels of a scene that buildings are casting correct shadows, all the way down to details like you see on the dirt here, all working in concert and without distinguishable boundaries. There’s a good decade of foundational work there to make the lighting work. In particular, when you see the very detailed shadows interplaying between the ice and the dirt there, there’s screen space sliding. There’s actually shadow calculation going on, not based on the world, but on the pixels on the screen because that is the only way that we could possibly do these calculations fast enough, running them on a pixel shader."

Even though it’s only an approximation and isn’t perfect, it looks perfectly good to the human eye and gives you the subtle shadowing that you see in a scene like this that makes it look highly realistic.

Fundamentally, AI just doesn’t have anything resembling an understanding of the entire scene they’re in, the entire arc of the movie or plot they’re in and the entirety of the world around them and how it might affect the scene. Whereas game engines have that exactly where they need to be.

In the videos you saw, it’s the rocks and the trees and the snow and the bridge and the people and all of these things. Each one has enormous amounts of data attached to it. Some are like texture maps, some are sound files, some are animation files and enormous amounts of detail all stored there in that procedural and in this precise computer graphics representation that enables rendering it from any perspective with any settings and so on. It’s a completely general system that has complete context about the state of the world at any point. You can always precisely reproduce it. If you play the same scene 10 times in a row, it’s always the same. It’s never randomly changing. You’re like, “Oh no, why did this character’s face change midstream?”"

It has a vast amount of knowledge about the world and about graphics and about images and about people and about everything else.

But it’s interesting to note that the laws of quantum mechanics themselves have a place for God or souls or whatever external source of input you might want to attach to such a thing and that there’s this idea of quantum waves function collapse, that when we look at a quantum system evolving in perfect superposition of many possibilities and you go to observe it, you actually just see a specific possibility in the multi-slit experiment. The light ultimately ends up being observed going through one slit or the other. That’s a place where there’s this random number of being injected into everything around us, trillions of trillions of trillions of times per second, and everything we’re observing.

To me, as we talked about creating ultra-realistic humans, eventually that means creating humans that can suffer, that can fall in love and experience heartbreak and loss, they can fear death.

If you’re playing Fortnite Battle Royale, in my view, that is capturing the essence of the metaverse, and it’s especially in Fortnite when we got Sony on board so that all players on all platforms in Fortnite could play together, could voice chat together, and could be part of a single game experience, it really took on a new nature, which was not just like a multiplayer game with Heritage from Doom, but also a true social experience between you and your friends.

All of the people at Epic and squads and experiencing that world that we realized that this trend was afoot and that we needed to do everything we could to bring in other creators so that anybody could pile on to the work we were doing by creating their own worlds through Fortnite, Creative and UEFN, and creating more games and more genres that people could play and ever expanding the repertoire of fun."

And so everybody in the company was given a week to form a team and work with whichever co-workers they wanted and build a game using Unreal Engine so you can actually build something pretty interesting in a week. And one of the teams built the very first version of what became Fortnite. The very first version of it had a different art style, but it had the idea at the core that you’re going to build forts by day using this building system. Then night would come and you’d defend the forts against zombies, and the longer you could go, the more elaborate forts you could build and the more survival waves you could withstand, and it would get cooler and cooler with time."

We’d realized that Fortnite could be really mainstream and it could be a game people play for a long time.

People play there because it’s super fun and because they’re playing there, they’re willing to buy cool stuff to make their character look cooler. And so you have all of these sources of engagement, but the sources of engagement don’t make money directly. You can’t spend money in Fortnite Battle Royale to buy a game item. The gameplay is not paid to win, and it’s all just a game. So we make money from the item shop and the item shop only adjusts because of the sources of engagement. If you weren’t playing Battle Royale, trust me, nobody would want to buy a Fortnite outfit. If you weren’t playing any Fortnite games, why would you buy Fortnite outfits?"

And the thing that magically makes the Fortnite creator economy works is revenue sharing, item shop spending according to sources of engagement by engagement. If you buy an item and you’ve played 40% of your time in Battle Royale and 60% of your time in these user modes, the amount you spent, the portion of that that’s profit can be separated out and paid out to all the different creators who participate in that economy. And that’s why Fortnite scaled up to a $400 million creator economy so far, and it’s growing."

If we had a standards body standardized what are portable outfits in games, game outfits you could buy in one game that work in another, what are their dimensions and what are their capabilities and what can you do and what can’t you do and so on. Then you could have an item economy where every game agrees to respect each other’s item purchases of that sort and revenue is shared between ecosystems as well."

It feels good when I put it on. And even the other outfit, I have two outfits, this and then a black t-shirt and jeans, and it feels good to wear that. It feels like me when I look in the mirror.

If you see anything, you’re seeing their butt as you’re trying to catch up to them jumping from object to object and they’re above you.

If some condition holds, then do this thing, otherwise do that thing. And in a language today, this is done with variables of type boolean or expressions that produce booleans. We have boolean variables that are either true or false. We have expressions that evaluate to booleans.

But the exciting thing about that is your expression that succeeds or fails can produce values and bind variables that are then accessed by the then branch. So you can write a conditional where you can only get to the inside of the condition, to the then, if a bunch of variables have successfully been bound to variables.

So you gain the power of SQL queries, large complex queries that are data structures in a language that is much simpler in which your code is just performing simple iterative operations.

And so, one critical component that is the ability to release an update to something you’ve already published and be sure that it’s backwards compatible with the one that you’ve already released. And that’s essentially a type checking problem, checking that your new interface is backwards compatible with your old one. And that comes down to the type system of the language.

And that’s a problem for type checking. Like, say you have a function that promises to return some integer, well, in the future you could say that returns some natural number because every natural number is an integer. So that’s a backwards compatible change, but you can’t say it returns a rational number because some rational numbers are not integers. So the system ought to reject that kind of change."

The Pythagorean theorem is a cool one, but one theorem you might have in a program is like the theorem that this function takes an array of integers and returns an array of the same integers, but the result is sorted. If you express that as a theorem and you follow this system of type theory, then you can actually require that anybody who writes that sorting function to prove that it has actually sorted its result.

Even with Joe Rogan, they let go, it’s wide open.

I think some answer is required there. A better UI is great. Steam is super polished. Epic Games Store in time will hopefully be as polished. How does that overcome the fact that your entire library over the past 15 years is there, if developers have been afraid to exercise their own economic interests? Because it’s in a developer’s interest to sell on Epic and get 18% more of the revenue. I think there’s a real power to incumbents. It’s very hard to overcome for just being there and being as good."

The all-in cost of operating the Google Play Store, stocking it, maintaining it, the software, the entire ecosystem is around 6% of revenue. So in a competitive market, would a company whose cost is 6% be able to charge 30%? Absolutely not. And Apple’s costs are similar. Apple runs an even more efficient and lean operation than Google. So their costs are also likely in the range of 6% all in. They market up from 6% to 30%. Only a monopoly can do that. Look at competitive businesses, they have a margin of a few percentage.

And when you look at a lot of the games that failed recently, they just didn’t deliver fun or they didn’t deliver fun in a manner that was nearly competitive with the other sources of fun just in people’s lives. And so at a basic level, we don’t need a terribly complicated theory to explain a lot of the malaise in the game industry. There’s just been a degradation of the capabilities of a lot of publishers, partly because of competition for talent. Companies like really vibrant game businesses like Epic or Riot or others, are hiring the best developers and accumulating them. And big tech companies are hiring the best game developers because there’s super talent there."

I think everything else that’s happened is kind of a sideshow to that. There’s always political drama and so on, but I think the just the core is a failure to deliver fun, and the nature of fun is changing. It turns out that playing a game together with your friends in a really socially engaging way with voice chat is just way more fun than playing a solitary game for the most part. And there are exceptions to that, but I think we’re seeing much, much more playtime shifting towards games you’re playing together with your friends. And not just random internet strangers who happen to play that game too, but the people you actually know in the real world. And that’s certainly been the case with me and with almost everybody I know who’s playing Fortnite or similar games."

But in a multiplayer game, if there are 20 games out, and each one might have their own completely individual preference and each one were independently choosing which game to play, each one might buy a different game, but they’re all realizing that they want to play together. And so what players are doing increasingly is playing a game they like and accept together with their friends, even if it’s not the game that every one of them might be preferring to play themselves. And that’s certainly the case in different Fortnite groups I play with from time to time. It’s like one player might have been preferring to play COD, one might have been preferring League of Legends, somebody else, something completely random, but it’s just so fun to play together, we’re doing that."

And over the past year or so, it’s taken a really, really strong turn towards increasing rate of change, increasing numbers of players coming to Fortnite. We hit an all time high of 110 million monthly active users about a year ago."

And we’re seeing another trend overlaid with that, which is like when an awesome single player game comes out or a smaller multiplayer game comes out, people often will treat it as a vacation. They’ll go off and play that game for a while, then come back. And I think Wukong was an awesome example of that, a wonderful game from a brilliant team in China. They made a game that’s like no Western players had really seen that type of thing done before and it was awesome and it did well, but most players play it for a while and move back on. And that can be lucrative. But a business that’s building that kind of game is going to have to build a new one every few years and build a business around that, while the other games continue to accrete users."

And there are things that Epic can do with a team of thousands of people building Fortnite internally, and tens of thousands contributing to Fortnite as independent creators. There are just things that can happen with that level of investment that can’t happen in a smaller game. And so there’s somewhat of an increasing winner-take-all dynamic where the biggest games reinvest more to make their games more fun, to gain fun at a faster rate than other games.

There are big games, or games that have the potential to be really big multiplayer experiences that keep players around indefinitely for very long periods of time, and then there are just really good and small-scale games that people are taking a break from their big games for. And the trend there is going to be towards efficiently developing those games. You can’t build one of those games with a $300 million budget, but if you can do it with a $40 million budget, you can make a lot of money. So I think that’s the main reshaping going on and think that it creates a rather bleak outlook for a lot of the category of single-player games that don’t have a huge audience to reach. But this is just one of the really trends of restructuring the business around the technology and changes of the day."

That was like a world that they created, a recent game, Baldur’s Gate 3, that was a really incredible piece of work and art and doing a lot of innovative stuff, again in the single-player domain.

The attention to detail, and there’s something there that’s big. It’s been funny journeying through the industry. I last designed a game in 1992. I’m not a game designer. I have a very open-minded view that the best game genre that will ever exist has not yet been invented. And as we get more technological capabilities and creatives people use that and hopefully empowered by higher productivity tools and so on that we’ll see more and more cool things emerge that we’d never dreamed possible. And the idea of a world simulator is actually really interesting there. It’s been tried a lot.

And I’m not the secret holder, I’m not on the design team, I experience Fortnite as a player, but it really exudes a lot of that and a good spiritedness as well, because even when you’re eliminated in Fortnite, there’s not blood spurts and there’s not gibs, you’re just teleported out of the simulation. And often you end up losing the game in a way that’s hilarious enough that actually you’re laughing at it or you’re like respect to that player who just won because that was clever.

The level with which Rockstar has brought quality to that genre is astonishing. And when you’re building something at a level of quality and detail that’s never been achieved before, you can’t predict how long it will take. Whatever problems you’re solving today to get to the next iteration of quality on it, you don’t know what new problems that will unlock.

And if any late breaking problems emerge in balance or anything else, it’s usually towards the end. And that usually leads to a rapid push to fix it.
